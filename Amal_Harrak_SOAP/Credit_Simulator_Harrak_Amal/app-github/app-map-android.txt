About
I created this app in the first semester of my masters (last year(2019)), as a project for a class named android programming.

This app is written in Java.

It is built using the Google Map API, it has a local SQLite database and it is connected to an online PHP/MySQL database.


Features
Users can save places they visit/like, with a description and a rating in the online db
Users can see all the places saved by others and locate them in the map
Users can rate different places
Users can synchronise the online database and the local one, for an offline acces to data
Users can search locations and see/locate them in the map
Users can locate themselves in the map (if they are using GPS)
Users can change the type of the map
